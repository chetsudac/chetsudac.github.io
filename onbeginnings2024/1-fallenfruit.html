            ⬤ In poetry, the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings ⬤ that we cannot even conceive of it. ⬤ Not every poem is finished—one poem is ⬤ abandoned, another ⬤ catches fire and is ⬤ carried away by the wind, ⬤ which may be an ending, but it is the ending of ⬤ a poem without an end.

            ⬤ Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said that ⬤ no poem is ever ended, that every ⬤ poem is merely ⬤ abandoned. ⬤ This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for where quotations ⬤ begin is in a cloud.

            ⬤ Paul Valéry also described his perception of ⬤ first lines so vividly, and to my mind so accurately, ⬤ that i have never forgotten it: ⬤ the opening line of ⬤ a poem, he said, is like finding ⬤ a fruit on the ground, a piece of ⬤ fallen fruit you have never seen before, and the poet’s task is to ⬤ create the tree from which such ⬤ a fruit would fall.
