        Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their poems begin, 
        the answer is always the same: 
        <br><br>a phrase, <br>a line, <br>a scrap of language, 
        <br>a rhythm,
        <br>an image, 
        <br>something seen, 
        <br>heard, 
        <br>witnessed, 
        <br>or imagined. 
        <br><br>And the lesson is always the same, 
         and young poets recognize this to be one of the most important lessons they can learn: 
         <br><br>if you have any idea for a poem, 
         an exact grid of intent, 
         you are on the wrong path, 
         a dead-end alley, 
         at the top of a cliff you haven't even climbed.
         This is a lesson that can only be learned by trial and error. </p> </div>

        I believe many fine poems begin with ideas, 
        but if you tell too many faces this, 
        or tell it too loudly, they will get the wrong idea. </div>

        The painter Cy Twombly quotes John Crowe Ransom, on a scrap of paper: “The image cannot be disposed of a primordial freshness which ideas can never claim.”
        <br><br>
        Easy and appropriate thing for a painter to say. Cy Twombly uses text in some of his drawings and paintings, usually poetry, usually Dante. 
        Many men and women have written long essays and lectures on the ideas they see expressed in Twombly's work. </div>
