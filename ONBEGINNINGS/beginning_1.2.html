        Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said that 
        <br><br>
        no poem is ever ended, <br> that every poem <br>is merely <span class="abandoned">abandoned</span>.
        <br><br>
        <br><br>
        This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, <br>for where quotations begin is in a cloud.

        Paul Valéry also described his perception of first lines so vividly, 
        <br>and to my mind so accurately, that i have never forgotten it: 
        <br><br>
        the opening line of a poem, he said, 
        <br><i>is like <span class="paul">finding a fruit on the ground</span>, 
        <br>a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, 
        <br>and  <span class="paul">the poet's task is to create the tree from which such a fruit would fall</i></span>.
    </p></div>

    Gaston Bachelard says the single most succinct and astonishing thing: 
    <br><br>
    We begin in <span style="color:#5E94D1">admiration</span> and we end by <span style="color:#DA400B">organizing our disappointment</span>. 
    <br><br>The moment of admiration is <span class="adm">the experience of something unfiltered, vital and fresh—it could also be horror</span> —
    and the moment of organization is <span class="org">both the onset of disappointment and its dignification</span>; the least we can do is dignify our knowingness, the loss of some vitality through familiarization, by admiring not the thing itself but how we can organize it, think about it.
</p></div>
<div><p></p>
    Bachelard's sentence simply says this: 
    <br><br><span style="color:#5E94D1">origins</span> ( <span class="BE">beginnings</span> ) have <span style="color:#DA400B">consequences</span> ( <span class="EN">endings</span> ).
    <br><br>
    The poem is the consequence of its origins. Give me the fruit and I will take from it a see and plant it and watch grow the tree from which it fell.
