I will tell you what I miss: 
<br><br>I miss watching a movie and at the end, 
<br>huge scrolled words come on the screen and say:
<br><br><span class=the>The End.</span>
<br><br>I miss finishing a novel and there on the last page, 
<br>at a discrete distance from the last words of the last sentence, 
are the dark letters spelling 
<br><br><span class=end>The End.</span>
<br><br>
It was its own thrill. I didn't ignore them, I read them, <span class=read>even if only silently</span>, with a deep sense of feeling: 
<br><br><span class=feelings>both the feeling of being replete, <br><br>a feeling of satisfaction, <br><br>and the feeling of loss, <br><br>the sadness of having finished the book.</span>
<br><br>
I have never, in my life, 
<br>read <a href="beginning_4.2.html">a poem that ended with the words The End</a>.
<br>Why is that, I wonder. I think perhaps the brevity of poems compared to novels makes one feel that 
<br>there has been no great sustention of energy, <br>no marathon worthy of pulling tape across <br>the finish line.
