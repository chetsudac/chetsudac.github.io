        Western civilization rests upon those words. And yet there is a lively group of thinkers who believe that in <span class="act">the beginning was the Act</span>. that nothing can precede action—
        <br><span class=btl>no breath</span> before act, 
        <br><span class=btl>no thought</span> before act,
         <br><span class=btl>no pervasive love</span> before some kind of act.
        <br><br>
        I am afraid there is no way around this. It is the one try inevitable thing. And if you believe that, <span class=btl>then you are conceding that in the beginning was the act, not the word</span>.
        <br><br>
        But there is no book I know of on the subject of how poems begin. How can the origin be traced when there is no form or shape that precedes it to trace? It is exactly like tracing the moment of the big bang—we can go back to a nanosecond before the beginning, before the universe burst into being, but we can't go back to the precise beginning because that would precede knowledge, and we can't “know” anything before “knowing” itself was born.
        <br><br>
        I believe the poem is <a href="beginning_2.2.html">an act of the mind</a>. I think it is easier to talk about the end of a poem than it is to talk about its beginning. 
        <span class=ithink>Because the poem ends on the page, but it begins off the page, it begins in the mind.</span> 
          The mind acts, the mind wills a poem, often against our own will; somehow this happens, somehow a poem gets written in the middle of a chaotic holiday party that has just run out of ice, and it's your house.
