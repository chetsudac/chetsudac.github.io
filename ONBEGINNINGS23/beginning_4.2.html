        And then I found a poem of mine that I had carefully written by hand in the sixth grade, 
        and at the bottom of the page, in India ink, beautifully apart from the rest of the text, were the words The End.
        And I realized children very often denote the end because it is indeed a great achievement for them to have written anything, 
        and they are completely unaware of the number of stories and poems that have already been written; 
        they know some, of course, but have not yet found out the extent to which they are not the only persons residing on the planet. 
        And so they sign their poems and stories like kings. Which is a wonderful thing. </p></div>

        Roland Barthes suggests there are three ways to finish any piece of writing: 
        the ending will have the last word or the ending will be silent or the ending will execute a pirouette, do something unexpectedly incongruent.</p></div>

        Barbara Henstein Smith, in her book Poetic Closure: A Study of How Poems End, 
        says this: “Perhaps all we can say, and even this may be too much, 
        is that varying degrees or states of tension seem to be involved in all our experiences, 
        and that the most gratifying ones are those in which whatever tensions are created are also released. 
        Or, to use another familiar set of terms, an experience is gratifying to the extent that those expectations that are aroused are also fulfilled.”</p></div>
